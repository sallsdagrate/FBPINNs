    "\n",
    "> `fbpinns` uses [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) as its main computational engine. To be able to use JAX effectively (in particular its `jit` compilation), we need to write **[functionally pure](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax-101/07-state.html)** code. This means that any functions we write which are compiled (which include most of the class methods above) should not have any **side-effects** - that is, all the input data is passed through the function parameters, all the results are output through the function results. An important consequence of this is that we should not refer to, or update, the class state (i.e. use `self` in standard Python classes), as this may have unexpected consequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure functionally purity, all the class methods above are defined as `staticmethods`, and any initial parameters of the class (output by `init_params`) are explicitly passed to each method in the `all_params` argument (rather than saving them to `self`).\n",

    "\n",
    "There is one extra static argument which is required - `dims`, which is a tuple `(ud,xd)` which defines the dimensionality of the solution and the problem domain (in this case, both are 1 dimensional).\n",

    "We specify the input points and labels by using `jnp.array`s. The input points array should have dimensionality `(n,xd)` where `n` is the number of input points and `xd` is the dimensionality of the input points, and any label arrays should have dimensionality `(n,ld)` where `n` is the number of input points and `ld` is the dimensionality of each label.\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate the boundary loss, we need both the FBPINN solution ($u$) and its first order derivative ($u_t$). We specify the solution and gradients components required by using tuples, where the first value of the tuple denotes the solution component index required and its trailing tuple indicates the indices of any coordinates we require gradients with respect to (for example, `(0,())` states that we need $u$ and `(0,(0,))` states that we need $u_{t}$ for our problem).\n",

    "For the **physics loss**, we sample input points throughout the domain (using the `sample_interior` helper function of the `fbpinns.domains.Domain` class passed to the method).
