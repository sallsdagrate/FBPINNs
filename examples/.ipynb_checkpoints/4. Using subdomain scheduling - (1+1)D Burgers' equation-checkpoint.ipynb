    "# 4. Using subdomain scheduling - (1+1)D Burgers' equation\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows you how to use subdomains scheduling to train a FBPINN.\n",
    "\n",
    "# What is subdomain scheduling?\n",
    "\n",
    "An advantage of using domain decomposition for FBPINNs is that we can control which **parts** of the domain are solved at each training step.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is useful if we want to control how boundary conditions are **communicated** across the domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we can define a **time-stepping scheduler** to solve time-dependent PDEs, and learn the solution forwards in time from a set of initial conditions (see gif below).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is done by specifying a **subdomain scheduler** (from `fbpinns.schedulers`), which defines which subdomains are actively training and which subdomains have fixed parameters at each training step.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Problem overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we will use a time-stepping subdomain scheduler to train a FBPINN to solve the (1+1)D time-dependent Burgers' equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/scheduling.gif\" width=\"70%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The exact partial differential equation (PDE) and boundary conditions we will solve for are:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\dfrac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + u \\dfrac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = \\nu \\dfrac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $u(x,t)$ is the speed of the fluid and $\\nu$ defines the scalar viscosity of the flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "This exact problem is already defined in the `fbpinns.problems.BurgersEquation2D` problem class.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Workflow overview\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the following steps to define a scheduler and train the FBPINN:\n",
    "1. Define a `fbpinns.schedulers.ActiveScheduler` class\n",
    "2. Train the FBPINN using this `ActiveScheduler` class\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Define a `fbpinns.schedulers.ActiveScheduler` class\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inheriting the `ActiveScheduler` class\n",
    "\n",
    "All scheduler classes should inherit from the base `fbpinns.schedulers.ActiveScheduler` class:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class ActiveScheduler:\n",
    "    \"\"\"Base scheduler class to be inherited by different schedulers\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __init__(self, all_params, n_steps):\n",
    "        self.n_steps = n_steps\n",
    "        self.m = all_params[\"static\"][\"decomposition\"][\"m\"]\n",
    "        self.xd = all_params[\"static\"][\"decomposition\"][\"xd\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __len__(self):\n",
    "        return self.n_steps\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __iter__(self):\n",
    "        \"\"\"\n",
    "        Returns None if active array not to be changed, otherwise active array.\n",
    "        active is an array of length m, where each value corresponds\n",
    "        to the state of each model (i.e. subdomain), which can be one of:\n",
    "\n",
    "        0 = inactive (but still trained if it overlaps with active models)\n",
    "        1 = active\n",
    "        2 = fixed\n",
    "        \"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "        raise NotImplementedError\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`ActiveScheduler`s are simply **Python iterables** which output an `active` array, which is a flat vector which indicates which subdomains are active or fixed at each training step.\n",
    "\n",
    "During training, the scheduler is iterated over and if the `active` array changes, the input training points to the FBPINN and the trained subdomains are changed appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "The length of the active array should equal the number of subdomains in the FBPINN, which is stored in the `all_params[\"static\"][\"decomposition\"][\"m\"]` parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using a pre-defined `ActiveScheduler`\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some pre-defined `ActiveScheduler`s in `fbpinns.schedulers`. In particular for the problem above we can use `fbinns.schedulers.LineSchedulerRectangularND` to time-step, which is appropriate for the `RectangularDecompositionND` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case all we need to do is define the initialisation values of the class:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "scheduler_kwargs = dict(\n",
    "    point=[0.], iaxis=0,\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "which indicates the starting time of the scheduler ($t=0$) and the axis along which the line of active models is defined (the $x$-axis). "
